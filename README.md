# book-inventory
Python application to inventory books in your physical library

The goal is to create an application to track physical books in your library using ISBN to pull information from Openlibrary. 


Plan:

-start with .csv storage format (populate book data from one query, populate author field from a second query)

-populate from openlibrary api



Possible features include:

-location of book at the bookcase/shelf level

-read y/n tag

-last read date/year

-book genre tags

-random book recommendation

-notes

-rating

-shelf audit (auditing book inventory by location)

-lookup by author/books by the same author

-thumbnail image pull from openlibrary

-vision functionality to add books using camera (ISBN read)

-android app, web app


api-query.py is the framework for querying Openlibrary, to be implemented as a function later
